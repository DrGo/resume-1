resume
------

My resume. The contents are written in YAML, which is compiled to LaTeX with the `build` Go file, which is compiled to PDF with the `makefile`.

Just run `make`.

The LaTeX uses the `res.cls` file that was written by Michael DeCorte back when dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Also, the project was inspired by @david12 and also by the fact that I hate modifying a resume *document*. It's easiest to generate everything.
