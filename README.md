resume
------

My resume. The contents are written in YAML, which is compiled to LaTeX with the `generate.go` file, which is compiled to PDF with `pdflatex`.

Just run `make`.

The LaTeX uses the `res.cls` file that was written by Michael DeCorte back when dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Also, the project was inspired by @divad12 and also by the fact that I hate modifying a resume *document*. Since I'm a programmer... why not spend 5x as long writing something to generate my resume rather than just modifying what I had previously? Saves me time in the future. Word.
