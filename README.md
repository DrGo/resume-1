resume
------

Currently html.
I will make the resume more dynamic once I do my other more important learning projects.

TODO:  
1. Write a markdown text resume file 
2. Convert to HTML (modify my blog)  
3. Do other things that are way more important  
4. Learn YAML   
5. Learn Python  
6. Look at @divad12's page to understand what he is doing with his genresume.py code  
7. Write resume in YAML (or leave in .md?), write LaTeX file and write Go code to generate .txt, .pdf
